# WHAT IS A/B TESTING
![ab-testing-scaled](https://github.com/minhducgon/AB_Testing/assets/121803855/86e5fbdf-1b27-4cc3-a04d-6f694bbaf092)
- A/B testing is essentially an experiment where two or more versions of a variable are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.
# A/B TESTING USING PYTHON
- In this notebook we'll go over the process of analysing an A/B test, from formulating a hypothesis, testing it, and finally interpreting results.
- For my data, I'll use a dataset which contains the results of an A/B test on what seems to be 2 different designs of a website page (old_page vs. new_page). Here's what I'll do:
  1. Designing my experiment
  2. Collecting and preparing the data
  3. Visualising the results
  4. Testing the hypothesis
  5. Drawing conclusions
# BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT
* The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is about **13%** on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of **2%**, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to **15%**.
